    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Hello, I’m Gautam, a data analyst and web developer with a passion for turning complexity into clarity—whether it’s through clean code, insightful data visualizations, or intuitive user experiences. My journey blends analytical precision with creative problem-solving, driven by a deep curiosity and a commitment to continuous growth.</p>

    <p>With a solid foundation in Python, JavaScript, PHP, and CSS, I specialize in building responsive web interfaces and debugging with a methodical approach. I also explore data through tools like Pandas and Matplotlib, uncovering patterns that inform smarter decisions.</p>

    <p>I learn best by doing—through hands-on projects, structured guidance, and step-by-step experimentation. Whether I’m refining a layout, solving an algorithmic challenge, or visualizing trends, I bring resilience, clarity, and a growth mindset to everything I build.</p>

    <p>Currently, I’m focused on mastering full-stack development and deepening my data analysis skills, while balancing my technical journey with personal transformation and creative expression.</p>
